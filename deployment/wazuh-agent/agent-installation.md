# Wazuh Agent Installation

In this project, a Wazuh agent was installed on the victim machine (Ubuntu Server)
to collect system and security logs.

The agent was configured to communicate with the Wazuh Manager,
allowing centralized monitoring through the Wazuh Dashboard.

This step enabled:
- Log collection
- File Integrity Monitoring
- SSH authentication monitoring
