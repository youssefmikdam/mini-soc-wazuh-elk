# SSH Brute Force Attack

In this project, an SSH brute force attack scenario was studied.

Multiple failed SSH login attempts were generated from the attacker machine.
These attempts were recorded in the system authentication logs.

Wazuh analyzed these logs and detected abnormal behavior,
generating a security alert visible on the dashboard.

This scenario demonstrates how a SOC can detect unauthorized access attempts.
