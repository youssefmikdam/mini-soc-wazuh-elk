# SQL Injection Detection

In this project, a SQL injection attack scenario was analyzed through
web server logs.

Suspicious HTTP requests containing abnormal parameters were sent to
the web application.

These requests were recorded in the Apache access logs.

Wazuh analyzed the logs and detected patterns associated with SQL
injection attempts.

A security alert was generated and visualized on the dashboard.

This scenario demonstrates how log analysis can help a SOC detect
application-layer attacks.
